## Lab 2 Block 2: Scaling and Monitoring  
### To Complete the Assignment  
Use AWS Academy resources to perform the following tasks:

- Re-visit/study **Module 10: Auto Scaling and Monitoring**  
- Perform **Lab 6**, including additional tasks to investigate **CloudWatch functionality**:  
  - Monitor metrics and dashboard visualization, use of Alarms.  
  - Select components and metrics to monitor.  
  - Provide observations and suggestions for using cloud monitoring services in your project.  

    
## Self-Check/Self-Study Questions on Cloud Monitoring  
1. What metrics would you use for your website serving as:

   - A streaming music website?  
   - An environment monitoring server collecting sensor data?  

2. What is the benefit of using a **dashboard** compared to individual service metrics?  

3. What is an **Event Bus**? How can you use it with your application? What are its inputs and outputs?  

4. What tools for **log collection and analysis** does AWS provide in addition to **CloudWatch**? What supporting services are involved? What are the costs of logging and analysis?  

5. What is the use of **CloudWatch Alarms**? How are alarms related to metrics? What other AWS services can be used with alarms? (*Hint: Consider SNS and others.*)  

6. Is **metrics collection** different for AMI/VMs, serverless/Lambda, and containerized applications?
